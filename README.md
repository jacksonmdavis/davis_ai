This is a collection of some of the AI/ML code I have been working on as part of my Master's program in AI.  Most of the earlier things I worked on are stored in the `davis_ml_lib` folder, and the `davis_ml_lib_demo` Notebook serves as a demonstration of some of the contents of that folder.

The `kNN_and_parameter_tuning` notebook, while simple, serves as a better example of more recent work, particularly in the documentation and testing.
