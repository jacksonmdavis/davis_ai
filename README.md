This is a collection of some of the AI/ML code I have been working on lately.  Most of the earlier things I worked on are stored in the `davis_ml_lib` folder and the `davis_ml_lib_demo` Notebook serves as a demonstration of some of the contents of that folder.

Some newer work is stored in the rest of the Notebooks in this repo.  For more info about me or to contact, check out https://www.sevenhillsmt.com/jackson-portfolio
